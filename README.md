CSV-to-KML
==========

My first disclaimer is that this is my very first attempt at using Git/Github. I am all about sharing this code to make a nice simple application that will convert excel documents into KML files. There are some products out there, but I would like to make an open source program for those who only need to do simple kml files. I appreciate any help.

This python script will take a csv file with name, lat, lon, and description columns and create a simple kml file.
