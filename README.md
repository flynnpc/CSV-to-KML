CSV-to-KML
==========
This code is a nice simple application that will convert excel documents with lat/longs into KML point files. There are some products out there, but I would like to make an open source program for those who only need to do simple kml files. I appreciate any help.

My first disclaimer is that this is my very first attempt at using Git/Github. I am all about sharing this code to make a nice simple application that will convert excel documents with lat/longs into KML point files. There are some products out there, but I would like to make an open source program for those who only need to do simple kml files. I appreciate any help.

V.1
Version is merely a pyton script that asks for some prompts to convert a csv into a kml. It doesn't have a GUI and it is very basic. 

V.2
The app was updated to have a GUI, along with some other features: A file dialogue to load the csv, and one to save the kml; the droplists are automatically populated with the csv headers to select lat,long, and point name; all columns are included in the description of the output kml.
